# GoogleSearchImageTest

I have put mostly everything in one file (ImageSearch) rather than using proper POM Model because script was small 
and only couple of cases were there.

ReadPropertyFile used for getting url and image path as per instruction.

I have used TestNG framework but not into POM. I have tried to cover 
everything by using normal and simple coding method.

I have used Google Chrome as a broweser.
